Handy data structures for elements keyed by string.

## Installing

If you use NPM, `npm install d3-collection`. Otherwise, download the [latest release](https://github.com/d3/d3-collection/releases/latest). You can also load directly from [d3js.org](https://d3js.org), either as a [standalone library](https://d3js.org/d3-collection.v1.min.js) or as part of [D3 4.0](https://github.com/d3/d3). AMD, CommonJS, and vanilla environments are supported. In vanilla, a `d3` global is exported:

```html
<script src="https://d3js.org/d3-collection.v1.min.js"></script>
<script>

var map = d3.map()
    .set("foo", 1)
    .set("bar", 2);

</script>
```
